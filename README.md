For this project, our team of 4 students finishing their bootcamp at Le Wagon had 2 weeks to create an app using Ruby On Rails.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<strong>Note 1:</strong> <br>
This app was designed for the screen of an Iphone 12 and is NOT responsive.
If you open it on a computer : right-click ==> inspect <br>

Then select the Iphone 12 or a similar screen size, and browse !

<strong>Note 2:</strong> <br>
Currently, the database contains only seeds, meaning you can search for an animal group of beavers/rats/ferrets, or snakes/worms. 
If you want to see a full list of animals, please go to www.pocket-zoo.com/animals.
